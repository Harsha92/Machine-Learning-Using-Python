# Introduction to Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a techinque used for solving the __classification problem__.<br/> And Classification is nothing but a problem of __identifing__ to which of a set of __categories__ a new observation belongs, on the basis of _training dataset_ containing observations (or instances) whose categorical membership is known. <br/>For example to predict:<br/> __Whether an email is spam (1) or not (0)__ or,<br/> __Whether the tumor is malignant (1) or not (0)<br/>__


Both Linear regression and Logistic regression are __supervised learning techinques__. But for the _Regression_ problem the output is __continuous__ unlike the _classification_ problem where the output is __discrete__. <br/>
- Logistic Regression is used when the __dependent variable(target) is categorical__.<br/>
- __Sigmoid function__ or logistic function is used as _hypothesis function_ for logistic regression. Below is a figure showing the difference between linear regression and logistic regression, Also notice that logistic regression produces a logistic curve, which is limited to values between 0 and 1. <br/>
