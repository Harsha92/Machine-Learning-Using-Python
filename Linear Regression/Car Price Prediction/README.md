## Car Price Prediction

There is an automobile company XYZ from Japan which aspires to enter the Indian market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their Indian and European counterparts.
They want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the Indian market, since those may be very different from the Japanese market. 
Essentially, the company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car
- How well those variables describe the price of a car
Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars across the Indian market.


**Business Objectives:**

You as a Data scientist are required to apply some data science techniques for the price of cars with the available independent variables. That should help the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels.
